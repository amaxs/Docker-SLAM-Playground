Docker-SLAM-Playground: Experiment common SLAM algorithms using [ROS](https://wiki.ros.org/noetic) and [POLARIS_GEM_e2 Simulator](https://gitlab.engr.illinois.edu/gemillins/POLARIS_GEM_e2)



## Polaris GEM e2 Simulator
This repository provides a simulated vehicle model of [Polaris GEM e2 Electric Cart](https://gem.polaris.com/en-us/e2/) in the [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/) simulation environment as well as [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) based sensors and controllers for autonomous-driving. The Polaris GEM e2 vehicle model was measured and modeled using Solidworks by Hang Cui and Jiaming Zhang. Hang Cui further constructed the URDF files of the vehicle model compatible with ROS, RViz, and Gazebo.
The simulator was initially developed for personal research with ROS Melodic and Gazebo 9 in Ubuntu 18.04 in Fall 2019. This simulator then became an essential teaching material for the course, [Principles of Safe Autonomy @ Illinois](https://publish.illinois.edu/safe-autonomy/), and the project subsequently received funding from the [Center for Autonomy](https://autonomy.illinois.edu/) at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Hang Cui further developed and upgraded the simulator to use ROS Noetic and Gazebo 11 in Summer 2021. This simulator is currently under active development for research and teaching.
